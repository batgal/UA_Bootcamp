    <h1>Prince Appreciation</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Prince Rogers Nelson</strong> (June 7, 1958 â€“ April 21, 2016) was
      an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer,
      actor and film director. Widely regarded as one of the greatest musicians
      of his generation, he was known for his flamboyant, androgynous persona
      and wide vocal range, which included a far-reaching falsetto and
      high-pitched screams. Prince produced his albums himself, pioneering the
      Minneapolis sound. His music incorporated a wide variety of styles,
      including funk, R&B, rock, new wave, soul, synth-pop, pop, jazz and hip
      hop. He often played most or all instruments on his recordings.
